/**
 * MVC View for a web interaction. Implementations are responsible
 * for rendering content, and exposing models. Multiple models can
 * be exposed by a single view.<br/>
 * View implementations should be threadsafe.
 * <p/>View implementations may differ widely. An obvious
 * implementation would be JSP based. Other implementations might be
 * XSLT based, or use an HTML generation library. This interface is
 * designed to avoid restricting the range of possible implementations.
 * <p/>Views should be beans. They are likely to be instantiated as
 * beans by a ViewResolver.
 * <br/>The interface is stateless.
