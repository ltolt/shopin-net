/**
 *  Extension of AuditedResource to be implemented by objects that
 * can provide performance information as well as a record of the number
 * of times they are accessed.
 * <br/>Implementing objects must ensure that implementing this interface
 * does <b>not</b> compromise thread safety. However, it may be acceptable
 * for slight innaccuracies in reported statistics to result from the
 * avoidance of synchronization: performance may be well be more important
 * than exact reporting, so long as the errors are not likely to be misleading.
 * <br>Serializable to support
 * use in the application and session objects of a web application.
