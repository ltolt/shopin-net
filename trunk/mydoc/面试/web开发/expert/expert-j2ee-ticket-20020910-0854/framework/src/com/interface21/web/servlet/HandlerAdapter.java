 * Interface that must be implemented for each handler type to
 * use the handler to handle a request.
 * This interface is used to allow the ControllerServlet to be indefinitely
 * extensible. The ControllerServlet accesses all installed handlers
 * through this interface, meaning that it does not contain code specific
 * to any handler type.
 * <br/>Note that a handler can be of type Object. This is
 * to enable handlers from other frameworks to be integrated
 * with this framework without custom coding.
 * <br/>This interface is not intended for application developers.</b>
 * It is available to handlers who want to develop their own web workflow.
 * Need one of these for each fancy handler type.
