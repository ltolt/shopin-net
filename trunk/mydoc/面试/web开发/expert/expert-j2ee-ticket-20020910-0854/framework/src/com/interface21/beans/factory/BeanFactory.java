/**
 * Interface to be implemented by objects that hold a number of
 * bean definitions, each uniquely identified by a String name. An independent
 * instance of any of these objects can be obtained (the Prototype
 * design pattern), or a single shared instance can be obtained 
 * (a superior alternative to the Singleton design pattern).
 * <p/>The point of this approach is that the BeanFactory is a central
 * registry of application components, and centralizes the configuring
 * of application components (no more do individual objects need to
 * read properties files, for example).
 * <br/>Normally the BeanFactory will load bean definitions stored in
 * a configuration source (such as an XML document),
 * and uses the com.interface21.beans package to configure the beans. However,
 * an implementation could simply return Java objects it creates as
 * necessary directly in Java code.
